This is for testing the first step of the project: a simple inverted pendulum robot
In this mode the robot will have its legs locked out to a singularity so it essentially
performs as if it was a typical two wheeled balancing inverted pendulum robot.

NOTE: do not forget to set the Maestro's serial mode to be "USB Dual Port"
